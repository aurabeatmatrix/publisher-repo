What’s wrong with this world?  
                    When fear becomes our guide  

What’s wrong with this world?  
                      When hope is locked inside  
 
We’re screaming at the void, but nobody replies  
              Tell me what’s wrong with this world 
  
                                    tonight  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We build our walls in silence, drunk on empty speech  
Promises are headlines, but truth is out of reach  
Kings trade our futures for a pocketful of lies  
While children learn to pray for a dawn that never rises  

So tell me, who decides what price we’re gonna pay?  

What’s wrong with this world?  
When fear becomes our guide  
What’s wrong with this world?  
When hope is locked inside  
We’re screaming at the void, but nobody replies  
Tell me what’s wrong with this world tonight  

Forests burn to embers, oceans swallow shores  
We watch from safe distances, mindless as before  
Smoke climbs to heaven, chokes the poet’s plea  
Every breath a battle for our humanity  

And every warning sign we choose to ignore  

What’s wrong with this world?  
When fear becomes our guide  
What’s wrong with this world?  
When hope is locked inside  
We’re screaming at the void, but nobody replies  
Tell me what’s wrong with this world tonight  

When color is a sentence, born before the crime  
And justice wears a blindfold, drifting out of time  
We draw these silent borders on the lines of our own skin  
Erasing half our story just to keep the peace within  

How many hearts must break till we let love in?  

What’s wrong with this world?  
When fear becomes our guide  
What’s wrong with this world?  
When hope is locked inside  
We’re screaming at the void, but nobody replies  
Tell me what’s wrong with this world tonight  
  
This world is ours to save or lose  
No more hiding in our comfort zones  
Stand up, speak out, break the chains  
Ignite the spark — let’s roar your name  

What’s wrong with this world?  
When fear becomes our guide  
What’s wrong with this world?  
When hope is locked inside  
We’re screaming at the void, but nobody replies  
Tell me what’s wrong with this world tonight
