[Intro | 0:00–0:15]
[Instrumental: Soft guitar & synth loop]
[Choir (humming): SATB]

[Verse 1 | 0:15–0:45]
[Solo Vocal: Aretha Franklin]
We build our walls in silence, drunk on empty speech
Promises are headlines, but truth is out of reach
[Solo Vocal: Bruce Springsteen]
Kings trade our futures for a pocketful of lies
While children learn to pray for a dawn that never rises

[Pre-Chorus | 0:45–1:00]
[Vocal Duet: Aretha Franklin & Bruce Springsteen]
So tell me, who decides what price we’re gonna pay?

[Chorus | 1:00–1:30]
[Lead: Aretha Franklin & Bruce Springsteen alternating lines]
[Backing Choir: SATB + Children’s Choir]
What’s wrong with this world?
When fear becomes our guide
What’s wrong with this world?
When hope is locked inside
We’re screaming at the void, but nobody replies
Tell me what’s wrong with this world tonight

[Verse 2 | 1:30–2:00]
[Spoken-Word: Bob Dylan]
Forests burn to embers, oceans swallow shores
We watch from safe distances, mindless as before
[Sung: Bruce Springsteen]
Smoke climbs to heaven, chokes the poet’s plea
Every breath a battle for our humanity

[Pre-Chorus (variant) | 2:00–2:15]
[Vocal Layer: Bruce Springsteen & Choir]
And every warning sign we choose to ignore

[Chorus | 2:15–2:45]
[Lead: Aretha Franklin & Bruce Springsteen]
[Backing Choir: SATB + Children’s Choir]
What’s wrong with this world?
When fear becomes our guide
What’s wrong with this world?
When hope is locked inside
We’re screaming at the void, but nobody replies
Tell me what’s wrong with this world tonight

[Verse 3 | 2:45–3:15]
[Gospel Solo: Cissy Houston]
When color is a sentence, born before the crime
And justice wears a blindfold, drifting out of time
We draw these silent borders on the lines of our own skin
Erasing half our story just to keep the peace within

[Pre-Chorus (variant) | 3:15–3:30]
[Vocal Duet: Cissy Houston & Aretha Franklin]
How many hearts must break till we let love in?

[Chorus | 3:30–4:00]
[All-Star Ensemble: Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, Cissy Houston + Choir]
What’s wrong with this world?
When fear becomes our guide
What’s wrong with this world?
When hope is locked inside
We’re screaming at the void, but nobody replies
Tell me what’s wrong with this world tonight

[Bridge | 4:00–4:40]
[Rhythm Shift: muted drums & bass]
[Call & Response: Bob Dylan ⇄ Choir]
This world is ours to save or lose
No more hiding in our comfort zones
Stand up, speak out, break the chains
Ignite the spark — let’s roar your name

[Instrumental Break | 4:40–5:20]
[Guitar Solo: Bruce Springsteen]
[Strings Swell: Cinematic ensemble]

[Final Chorus (extended) | 5:20–6:05]

[Choir: Full SATB + Children’s Choir + Harmonizer]
What’s wrong with this world?
When fear becomes our guide
What’s wrong with this world?
When hope is locked inside
We’re screaming at the void, but nobody replies
Tell me what’s wrong with this world tonight

[Outro | 6:05–6:20]
[Ambient fade-out: synth pads & distant choir echo]
