[Style: Futuristic Ambient Electronica, 80 BPM, Slow-4/4, Wide stereo field, Lush reverbs, DEEP BASS]

[PRE INTRO: SILENCE - EMPTY UNIVERSE, a bottomless silence, stretched as wide as every possibility at once. No star, no echo, only the distant hum of a place with no name yet. Within it rests a single whisper of time.]

[Intro, Instrumental, Ambient, Ethereal, Layered shimmering pads create a soothing, futuristic atmosphere, Subtle white-noise sweeps fade in, paired with distant cybernetic blips, A soft, minimalistic arpeggio emerges, slowly pulsing in tempo, Low-frequency hums add depth, setting an introspective mood, **Chords: Cmaj7 – Am7 – Em9 – Fmaj7**]

[THE BEGINNING, A gentle glimmer breaks the darkness. Like filmy smoke, light drifts between worlds: soundless ripples that curl, swell, take shape. From nothing, a first breath is born – a cosmic heartbeat that becomes the pulse of the quiet arpeggio.]


[Verse 1, Instrumental, Melancholic, Reflective, Deep, melancholic synth line flows gently beneath airy vocal pads, Hypnotic clicks and soft snares provide a minimal rhythm, The melody evolves slowly, creating space for introspection, Subtle bass swells enhance the emotional depth, **Chords: Am7 – Fmaj7 – Cmaj7 – Gadd9**]

[THE AWAKENING,Between veils of mist, awareness stirs. A soul – perhaps yours – floats weightless through iridescent clouds of memory. Every click, every soft snare releases fragments: old dreams, WHO AM I]


[Pre-Chorus, Instrumental, Progressive, Pulsating, Rising arpeggios on futuristic synths layered with textured noise, Gentle claps and deep kicks introduce the rhythm, Builds steadily toward the chorus, tension heightens with every bar, **Chords: Fmaj7 – G6 – Am7 – Em7**]


[THE SUN]

[Chorus, Instrumental, Futuristic, Hypnotic, Soaring lead synth paired with a deep, pulsating bassline, Dynamic layers of rhythmic pads and bright percussive textures, A powerful, rhythmic drive with inspiring, progressive harmonies, **Chords: Cmaj7 – G(add13) – Am9 – Fmaj7**]

[THE LIGHT IS SHINING]


[Bridge, Instrumental, Introspective, Atmospheric, Stripped-down soundscape of immersive pads and shimmering textures, Delicate vocal chops or soft spoken-word phrases hover over the ambience, Creates a meditative space, a moment of calm before the climax, **Chords: Em9 – Dm9 – Cmaj7 – Bbmaj7**]

[FEEL THE GLOW]


[Final Chorus, Instrumental, Ethereal, Dynamic, All elements converge into a rich, layered soundscape, Lush pads, futuristic synths, and pulsating basslines drive the rhythm, Added percussive layers and high-energy arpeggios push the emotional intensity, **Chords: Cmaj7 – G(add13) – Am9 – Fmaj7 – G6**]

[FEEL THE WARMTH]


[Outro 1, Instrumental, Soothing, Reflective, Gradual reduction to soft, shimmering pads and fading arpeggios, Distant cybernetic blips and faint white noise drift into silence, Ends on a calming, meditative note, leaving the listener in introspection, **Chords: Cmaj7 – Am7 – Fmaj7 – Cmaj7**]
