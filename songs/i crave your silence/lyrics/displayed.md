"Can you taste the quiet on my lips?"  

Why do you chase my echo when I flee?  
Why do you bind my shadows to your plea?  
What do you crave in broken lullabies?  
When all my stars burn out, who will hear my cries?  

Creep in. 
On trembling heartbeat, baiting silent moans  
You trace my fractures, claim them as your own  
Is your voice a requiem for bones?  
Tonight, I taste regret on every breath  
Like acid rain, burning paths of death  
I let you wander through my hollow chest  
While I confess the ghosts that never rest  


Bleed through the static, steal my calm
Twist all my whispers into psalm
Drown inside sockets where shadows form
Hold me suspended, far from norm  

I crave your silence  
I crave, I crave, I crave… your silence  
I crave, I crave, I crave…  

Why do you chase my echo when I flee?  
Why do you bind my shadows to your plea?  
What do you crave in broken lullabies?  
When all my stars burn out, who will hear my cries?  

Step back  
When dawn unfolds your borrowed breath  
You carved your lies beneath my flesh  
Hollow confessions in moonlit mesh  
Will you recite the vows you left unsaid?  
I trace the scars you wove in threads  
And build my fortress from words unread  
While drowned illusions fill my head  

Now my bones, they weigh like lead  
Whispered curses fill my head  
I traded truth for broken threads  
Now I can't escape the webs  

Bleed through the static, steal my calm
Twist all my whispers into psalm
Drown inside sockets where shadows form
Hold me suspended, far from norm  

I crave your silence  
I crave, I crave, I crave… your silence  
I crave, I crave, I crave…  

Why do you chase my echo when I flee?  
Why do you bind my shadows to your plea?  
What do you crave in broken lullabies?  
When all my stars burn out, who will hear my cries?
