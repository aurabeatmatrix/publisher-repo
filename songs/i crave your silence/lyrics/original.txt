[Style: Billie Eilish–inspired dark electropop with whisper vocals and minimal glitch production]
[Key: G minor]
[Tempo: 120 BPM]
[Live Atmosphere: subtle room clicks, distant breath, soft ambient drone]
[Instruments: deep sub-bass, sparse percussive clicks and 808s, granular synth pads, pitched-down vocal chops, light piano stabs]

[Intro: Whispered vocal, sparse sub-bass entrance, soft reversed synth swell]
"Can you taste the quiet on my lips?"

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
Why do you chase my echo when I flee?
Why do you bind my shadows to your plea?
What do you crave in broken lullabies?
When all my stars burn out, who will hear my cries?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish]
Creep in
On trembling heartbeat, baiting silent moans
You trace my fractures, claim them as your own
Is your voice a requiem for bones?
Tonight, I taste regret on every breath
Like acid rain, burning paths of death
I let you wander through my hollow chest
While I confess the ghosts that never rest

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Bleed through the static, steal my calm (Ahh)
Twist all my whispers into psalm (Ah-ahh)
Drown inside sockets where shadows form (Ahh)
Hold me suspended, far from norm

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I crave your silence
I crave, I crave, I crave… your silence
I crave, I crave, I crave…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
Why do you chase my echo when I flee?
Why do you bind my shadows to your plea?
What do you crave in broken lullabies?
When all my stars burn out, who will hear my cries?

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish]
Step back
When dawn unfolds your borrowed breath
You carved your lies beneath my flesh
Hollow confessions in moonlit mesh
Will you recite the vows you left unsaid?
I trace the scars you wove in threads
And build my fortress from words unread
While drowned illusions fill my head

[Bridge: Billie Eilish]
Now my bones, they weigh like lead
Whispered curses fill my head
I traded truth for broken threads
Now I can't escape the webs

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Bleed through the static, steal my calm (Ahh)
Twist all my whispers into psalm (Ah-ahh)
Drown inside sockets where shadows form (Ahh)
Hold me suspended, far from norm

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I crave your silence
I crave, I crave, I crave… your silence
I crave, I crave, I crave…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
Why do you chase my echo when I flee?
Why do you bind my shadows to your plea?
What do you crave in broken lullabies?
When all my stars burn out, who will hear my cries?
