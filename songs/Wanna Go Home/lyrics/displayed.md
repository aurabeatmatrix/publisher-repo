Day-oh, day-o  
Daylight comes, and I can't log off...

Wake up, blue screen, blinkin' like a curse,  
Clickinâ€™ in Zoom calls, just makinâ€™ it worse.  
Slack wonâ€™t shut up, boss in the feed,  
I need some sunlight, I need to be freed.  

Come, Missa Algorithm, tally me data!  
ðŸ“ˆ Lightâ€™s up â€” I wanna log out, bruh.  
Come, Missa Algorithm, tally me quota!  
ðŸ“‰ Lightâ€™s up â€” I wanna clock out, yuh.

Six foot, seven foot, eight foot crunch â€“  
Inbox explode, brain goes punch!  
Daylight comes, I wanna go hooooome...  
(Just let me ghost-mode, just let me roam)

My back hurt from that ergonomic lie,  
Every click feel like a corporate spy.  
Order bananas, drone drops at the gate,  
But Iâ€™m still stuck in this Zoom-meeting fate.

Clerk-man checkinâ€™ my timesheet slow,  
But AI knows more than he could ever show.  
A thousand clicks and zero feels,  
Digital chains on ergonomic wheels.


Day-oh, day-o!  
Daylight comes, and I can't log off.  
Day-oh, day-o!  
Daylight comes, I wanna go home.


I dream of boats, of mango trees,  
Of rhythms free from policies.  
My mindâ€™s on fire, the webcamâ€™s dead,  
I dance alone in my work-from-bed.

Come, Missa Tally-man, count my soul.  
Daylightâ€™s here â€“ and Iâ€™ve lost control.  
Come, Missa System, break that mold.  
Sunlightâ€™s free â€“ but my screenâ€™s still cold.

Six foot, seven foot, eight foot stack,  
Crypto rise, then market crack!  
Daylight comes â€” we wanna go hooooome!  
(And maybe, maybe... never come back.)

Day-oh, day-o...  
Daylight comes â€” we wanna go home.
