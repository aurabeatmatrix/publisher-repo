**[Style: Urban Reggae Pop | 2025 | Afrobeat-Influence | Chill Beat mit Dub-Bass | Call-and-Response mit Vocoder | Thema: Digital Work, Home Office Burnout, Banana as Symbol]**

**[Intro â€“ Tropical Dub Loop, Lo-Fi Vocoder Voice, relaxed tempo]**
Day-oh, day-o
Daylight comes, and I can't log off...

---

**[Verse 1 â€“ Chill Flow, laid-back groove, modern dialect]**
Wake up, blue screen, blinkin' like a curse,
Clickinâ€™ in Zoom calls, just makinâ€™ it worse.
Slack wonâ€™t shut up, boss in the feed,
I need some sunlight, I need to be freed.

**[Call & Response: Digital voice â€“ Chorus Vocoder Harmony]**
Come, Missa Algorithm, tally me data!
ðŸ“ˆ Lightâ€™s up â€” I wanna log out, bruh.
Come, Missa Algorithm, tally me quota!
ðŸ“‰ Lightâ€™s up â€” I wanna clock out, yuh.

---

**[Chorus â€“ Big pop hook with Afrobeat percussion]**
Six foot, seven foot, eight foot crunch â€“
Inbox explode, brain goes punch!
Daylight comes, I wanna go hooooome...
(Just let me ghost-mode, just let me roam)

---

**[Verse 2 â€“ Spoken-word meets trap cadence]**
My back hurt from that ergonomic lie,
Every click feel like a corporate spy.
Order bananas, drone drops at the gate,
But Iâ€™m still stuck in this Zoom-meeting fate.

**[Bridge â€“ Minimal Beat, Inner monologue FX]**
Clerk-man checkinâ€™ my timesheet slow,
But AI knows more than he could ever show.
A thousand clicks and zero feels,
Digital chains on ergonomic wheels.

---

**[Break â€“ Instrumental: Bass drop, tropical synth solo]**

---

**[Refrain â€“ Full vocals, choir echo FX]**
Day-oh, day-o!
Daylight comes, and I can't log off.
Day-oh, day-o!
Daylight comes, I wanna go home.

---

**[Verse 3 â€“ Slow-down, introspective tone]**
I dream of boats, of mango trees,
Of rhythms free from policies.
My mindâ€™s on fire, the webcamâ€™s dead,
I dance alone in my work-from-bed.

**[Call & Response â€“ Soulful choir-style Vocals]**
Come, Missa Tally-man, count my soul.
Daylightâ€™s here â€“ and Iâ€™ve lost control.
Come, Missa System, break that mold.
Sunlightâ€™s free â€“ but my screenâ€™s still cold.

---

**[Final Chorus â€“ Uplifting harmonies, beat opens up]**
Six foot, seven foot, eight foot stack,
Crypto rise, then market crack!
Daylight comes â€” we wanna go hooooome!
(And maybe, maybe... never come back.)

---

**[Outro â€“ Lo-Fi fadeout, echo voice]**
Day-oh, day-o...
Daylight comes â€” we wanna go home.
