**[Style: Neotraditional country, Americana, Bluegrass, Country folk, acoustic guitar, banjo, fiddle, mandolin, light percussion, rich three-part sibling harmonies]**

**[Tempo: 102 BPM, 4/4]**
**[Key: G major]**

**[Intro Instrumental: Fingerpicked acoustic guitar arpeggio, gentle banjo rolls, mandolin countermelody, four measures]**

**[Verse One]**
Mamaâ€™s old Chevy rattled down gravel roads,
Sunlight through the pines painted tales untold.
Dust on my boots from those cotton fields,
Where every heartbeat taught the dreams it yields.

**[Interlude One: Mandolin flourish, two measures]**

**[Verse Two]**
Thunder rolled across the Black Belt plain,
Fiddles on the porch calling out my name.
Every twist and turn wrote my destiny,
In the songs they sang of family.

**[Pre-Chorus: Harmony builds, light percussion enters]**
And with every mile the heart grows braver,
In simple truths we find our flavor.

**[Chorus]**
On Number Seven Road we learned to stand,
Sweet Georgia skies cradling this land.
Sisters by my side, voices intertwine,
Faith and freedom in each line.

**[Banjo Solo: Eight measures of rolling, melodic banjo]**

**[Verse Three]**
Moonlight shimmered on a rusted fence,
Whispered promises of recompense.
We chased the dawn in a two-lane chase,
To find our calling in that open space.

**[Interlude Two: Acoustic guitar solo, six measures, warm and melodic]**

**[Verse Four]**
Fields of golden wheat and amber waves,
Echoed stories of our yesterdays.
Footsteps faded but the echoes stay,
Guiding every chord along the way.

**[Pre-Chorus: Full harmony, fiddle accents]**
Every season teaches how to grow,
Through the highs and lows we always know.

**[Chorus]**
On Number Seven Road we found our voice,
In every trial we made our choice.
Three hearts in chorus, through joys and woes,
Forever bound where the long road goes.

**[Bridge: Stripped-back three-part harmony, soft acoustic guitar, four measures]**
Midnight stars above the county line,
Whispered dreams we claimed as mine.

**[Interlude Three: Banjo and mandolin duet, eight measures]**

**[Verse Five]**
Morning dew on fields of green and gold,
Stories older than the roads they hold.
We sing of love that time can never steal,
In every note our truth reveals.

**[Verse Six]**
Hope rides shotgun in that midnight ride,
Faith our compass with the stars as guide.
Together we will roam and find our home,
On every mile where our hearts may roam.

**[Chorus: Big finale with vocal harmonies, fiddle solo intertwines]**
On Number Seven Road our spirits soared,
In simple words our souls restored.
Sisters bound by blood and song,
On Number Seven Road we belong.

**[Outro Instrumental: Gentle fade of acoustic guitar arpeggio and soft banjo plucks, six measures]**
