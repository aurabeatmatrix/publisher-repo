Mamaâ€™s old Chevy rattled down gravel roads,
Sunlight through the pines painted tales untold.
Dust on my boots from those cotton fields,
Where every heartbeat taught the dreams it yields.


Thunder rolled across the Black Belt plain,
Fiddles on the porch calling out my name.
Every twist and turn wrote my destiny,
In the songs they sang of family.

And with every mile the heart grows braver,
In simple truths we find our flavor.

On Number Seven Road we learned to stand,
Sweet Georgia skies cradling this land.
Sisters by my side, voices intertwine,
Faith and freedom in each line.


Moonlight shimmered on a rusted fence,
Whispered promises of recompense.
We chased the dawn in a two-lane chase,
To find our calling in that open space.


Fields of golden wheat and amber waves,
Echoed stories of our yesterdays.
Footsteps faded but the echoes stay,
Guiding every chord along the way.

Every season teaches how to grow,
Through the highs and lows we always know.

On Number Seven Road we found our voice,
In every trial we made our choice.
Three hearts in chorus, through joys and woes,
Forever bound where the long road goes.

Midnight stars above the county line,
Whispered dreams we claimed as mine.


Morning dew on fields of green and gold,
Stories older than the roads they hold.
We sing of love that time can never steal,
In every note our truth reveals.

Hope rides shotgun in that midnight ride,
Faith our compass with the stars as guide.
Together we will roam and find our home,
On every mile where our hearts may roam.

On Number Seven Road our spirits soared,
In simple words our souls restored.
Sisters bound by blood and song,
On Number Seven Road we belong.
