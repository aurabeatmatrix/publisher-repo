**[Style: Modern Gospel Proclamation, 2025, Spoken Word over deep ambient music and organ chords, solemn, uplifting, prayerful]**

**[Proclamation – Spoken with strength and reverence]**

Great are you, O Lord —
and your praise has no end.

Mighty is the fullness of your power,
and your wisdom is beyond all measure.

Still — even though we are but a small part of your creation —
we will praise you.
We, who are weighed down by mortality,
marked by the signs of our own sin,
a living proof that you resist the proud.

Yet still —
we long to lift our voices,
we, fragile though we are,
because you have made us for yourself.

And our hearts — oh Lord —
will stay restless
until they find rest in you.

**[Spoken Softly – Reflection with soft background choir hums]**

Teach me, Lord,
help me understand:

Do we first call on you — or first praise you?
Do we know you before we cry out to you — or cry out so that we may know you?

How can anyone call your name if they have never heard you?
How can anyone believe if no one has ever spoken your truth?

Those who seek you will praise you.
Those who seek you will find you.
And those who find you — will lift you high!

---

**[Proclamation – Rising energy, hands lifted]**

So I will seek you, O Lord,
I will call upon you in prayer,
and I will call upon you in faith —
because you have been proclaimed to us!

The faith you gave me, Lord, calls out to you.
The faith you breathed into me —
through the coming of your Son,
through the voice of your messengers —
this faith shouts your name.

**[Outro – Whispered, deep reverence, fading music]**

Restless are we,
until we rest in you.
